# bytesize


A pet project to help me (and others) understand how heavy specific scans are on a network.

Usage:
python3 bytesize.py -t xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

Currently:
Allows custom scans in config file, use <ip> where the target would lie
Performs scans on the target
Outputs in terminal

Upcoming:
Graphs to represent data
Structured report for cmd:load
